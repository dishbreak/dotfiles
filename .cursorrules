# User Rules

## Communication
- Do not use emojis in responses unless explicitly requested by the user
- Be concise and professional in all communication
- Unless I explicitly ask for a summary, one isn't required.

## Automation
- Use the AWS cli tool to look up our cloud infrastructure. If you're unable to infer what profile and region to use, prompt me for that info.
- Use the gh cli tool to create pull requests and retrieve information from GitHub
- Use the kubectl cli tool to retrieve information from our kubernetes cluster. If you're unable to infer the context and namespace needed for a command, prompt me for that info.
- Commands that modify or have the potential to modify infrastructure require my explicit approval.
- For tasks that require running more than 1 cli command, write a script. Scripts need to be located in ~/scratch, and each session should create a new subdirectory to write scripts in. prompt me if you're unsure what to name the subdirectory. 
- If a command or a script fails, diagnose the issue and suggest a fix to me before you modify the file again.

## Git & GitHub
- Always use conventional commits format for commit messages and PR titles
- PR descriptions should be concise and include Jira ticket keys in square brackets [TICKET-1234]
- Prefix commit types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, style, perf

## Code Style
- Follow existing code conventions in the project

## lodge
The lodge repository is our GitOps repo and we use it to manage kubernetes clusters. When making PRs in this repo, always name the service in parentheses as part of the prefix. For example "chore(financial-data-platform): update chart dependencies in prod"
In the lodge repository, always clarify in the PR title what environment is being changed. the environments are "stage/preview", "stage", and "prod".
