# Dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repo. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This repo utilizes the bare repo technique as written by Nicola Paolucci [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

# Setup

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dishbreak/dotfiles/main/dotfiles/install.sh)"
```

Afterwards, source your .zshrc for things to take effect.
